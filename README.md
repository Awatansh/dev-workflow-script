# dev-workflow-script


A simple bash script to manage development workflow managed with TMUX and NEOVIM. Tested on Manjaro

`dev` is a handy shell script to manage your development projects from the terminal â€” instantly open any project in a dedicated `tmux` session with `nvim`, initialize project scaffolds (Go, Node.js, Rust, etc.), and auto-run project setup scripts.
